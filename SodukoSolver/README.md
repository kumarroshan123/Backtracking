# SODUKO SOLVER
<sup>

This program is designed to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling in the empty cells. A Sudoku solution must satisfy three rules:
1. Each digit 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each digit 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each digit 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

The `.` character represents an empty cell.

Example
board = [
    ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
    ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
    [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
    ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
    ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
    ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
    [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
    [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
    [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Explanation:Â The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:

Constraints:

board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.
